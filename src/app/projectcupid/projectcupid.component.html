            <h5><mark><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></mark></h5>
            <p>As a student who learns from experiencing, I’m always looking for projects to work on. However, project teams require members from various backgrounds and skills that are beyond my abilities. So, my team and I created a platform where one could search for other individuals who wanted to also grow through working on a project together.</p>
            <p>Project Cupid is a <strong>web and mobile project finder service</strong> that gives students a platform to build project teams. Whether you are a student looking for a project to contribute to or a project lead looking for teammates, Project Cupid’s <strong>goal is to help students find the perfect match in teammates to bring their project ideas to life.</strong></p>

            The second shows a student looking for a project team to join.</p>

        <p>By visualizing the processes the user takes when using the application, we created a user flow to identify and understand how the user would navigate through ProjectCupid.
            This acted as a guide for determining the functional requirements and the navigational links for the wireframes and provided a basis for our user testing.

                    <p>With our functional prototypes, we conducted another round of user testing with 5 recruited participants to identify and characterize usability issues and evaluate the user flow throughout the application. 
                        These participants had different experiences with software interfaces, and the tasks we choose were more detailed and refined. 
                    From these evaluations, we learned that some design elements, such as color and font, needed to be adjusted to emphasize important information. We also fixed any issues we had functionality-wise.</p>

        <h4><mark><u><em><strong>Takeaways</strong></em></u></mark></h4>
        <p>Although my main responsibility for Project Cupid was the web mockups, I found it necessary to collaborate with the mobile mockups team in order to make sure the application is consistent all around. This project also included iterative cycles of user testing and refinement from the feedback, of which 
            I learned the importance of evalutions and the value it has on improving and catching the big and small issues from the application.</p>
